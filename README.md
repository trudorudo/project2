 Jakal - app for a better experience in the restaurants 
This app was created in a collaborative environment with a team of 3 people including myself. The main purpose of our web is to optimize waiting time in the line and optimize establishment work and to cut unnecessary spends by using our app.
The app allows on the user site simply get the menu on their phone by scanning QR code if the bar/restaurant and place the order. On the site of the owners of restaurants, the app allows uploading all information about restaurant and menu items (including such functionality as delete, update, add new items, menus, and locations)
